# Internship-Work

This repository contains the work completed during my internship, where I focused on applying various data science and machine learning techniques to real-world problems. The Work include data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building predictive models using algorithms like regression, classification, and clustering. Throughout the internship, I gained hands-on experience with Python, key libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, and learned how to analyze and interpret data to draw actionable insights.
